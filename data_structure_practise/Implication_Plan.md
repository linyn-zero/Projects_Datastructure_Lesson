# Implication Plan
I want to implication a practise about the data structrue I learn, and into a form of lib.

   -[x] min path Dijkstra 
   -[x] min path Dijkstra optimized with priority_queue 
   -[x] whole min path Floyd
   -[x] min generate tree Prim
   -[x] min generate tree Kruskal
   -[x] ToPo sorting
   - [ ] key path
2. Tree
   - [x] Binary Search Tree
   - [ ] AVL Tree
3. Disjoint Set
   - [x] UnionFind
